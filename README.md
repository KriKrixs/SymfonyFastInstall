# SymfonyFastInstall

Because installing Symfony can be rough and long.
I made a quick and simple shell script that deploy symfony and all the requirements:
- Node Version Manager (nvm)
- Latest LTS node version
- PHP 7.4
- Composer (globally)
- Symfony (globally)
- php-xml, php-dom, php-mbstring, php-intl, php-mysql

This script is not perfect at all, it is based on my little knowing on Shell Script.
